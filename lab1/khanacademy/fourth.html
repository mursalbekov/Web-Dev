    <p>
        The first of September is the first day of school. It is a happy day for all schoolchildren and their parents.<br> It is especially a great holiday for those boys and girls who are beginning to go to school.
        Let’s go out and see what people are doing in the streets this morning.<br> There are a lot of schoolchildren in the streets.They are going to school. Boys and girls are carrying schoolbags, many of them have flowers in their hands.<br> Senior pupils are going to school by themselves, but small children are going with their parents at their side.
        There are pupils in the schoolyard.<br> They are not playing games this morning. They are speaking about the summer holidays, about their new teachers and what is new at school.<br>Music is playing and soon a meeting begins. The pupils, their parents and other people who are present listen to the director’s speech.<br> Then a small girl with flowers is ringing the bell. The pupils are going to their classrooms and school year is beginning.

    <h5>First day in university</h5>
    <p>
        The first day at the university is an exciting experience for every student. On this day, you meet so many new people: fellow students and teachers.<br>
        You are trying to remember the names, the location of the classrooms and other organizational information. You need to get a student ID and find out the schedule of classes.<br>
        Students get acquainted, exchange phone numbers. Probably, this is the main thing that happens on the first day at the university. You are forming a new social circle.<br>
        I think this is important for every person. When students come to the university for the first time, they also can appreciate the design of the facilities and the technical equipment of the classrooms.<br>
        Fortunately, my university did not disappoint me.
